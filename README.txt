Please visit https://github.com/chunloklo/cs4641-unsupervised for the code.

Code to run experiments with each dataset is stored in separate ipynb files.
There are two datasets, the MAGIC Gamma telescope dataset and forest cover type dataset.

For the clustering code, please run
MAGICGamma.ipynb
CoverType.ipynb

For dimensionality reduction and dimensionality reduction then clustering clude, please run
DimReductionMAGIC.ipynb
DimReductionCovType.ipynb

For neural network testing for the MAGIC Gama telescope dataset, please run:
MAGICNN.ipynb
